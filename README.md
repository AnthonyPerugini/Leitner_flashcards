Ok what is the Lietner system and how does it improove memorization skills?

1. create a deck of flashcards (array of question/answer linked)
2. create 3 boxes (variable number boxes?)
3. start each card in Box 1

4. Each box carries with it a time-weight value, which determines the frequency of times a card will be shown to the user.
	e.g (Box1: EveryDay, Box2: everyOtherDay, Box3: onceAWeek)

5. Move cards to LOWER Box catagory if answered incorrectly, Move cards to HIGHER Box catagory if answered correctly.

6. variables to play around with - numBoxes: int, timePerBox: list 
	values array where len(values) == len(array) or a generator function?


Lets store the data in its simplist form, and then build the Class out based on the dict key, value pairs.
store with metadata that can be used to sort/filter the questions (subject, uuid, testNum, etc)

Dump from class where class structure looks something like -- pool: remaining questions unused for this study session, boxes: list of all boxes with list of question/answer pairs in each box)


FIRST DATASET TO MAKE:
	make a list of all the built-in data types and all the valid functions that can be called on them e.g. (str.replace(), list.append())
	make every possible combination of valid and invalid pairings.

	then do this for other libraries (os, re, itertools, collections, numpy, and more)

How hard could that be right?
